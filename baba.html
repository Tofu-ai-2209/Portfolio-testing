<h1>The pangolin</h1> 
<p> <i><b>The pangolin</b></i> is a unique and captivating creature, 
    often described as a walking pinecone due to the large, 
    keratin scales that cover its <u>entire body</u>, providing a tough, natural armor against predators. This solitary mammal, 
    native to parts of <b>Asia and Africa</b>, possesses a long, sticky tongue that can extend well beyond its body to quickly snatch up ants and termites, 
    its <mark>primary food source</mark>. When threatened, the pangolin's remarkable defense mechanism is to curl up into a tight, impenetrable ball, protecting its soft underbelly from harm. Despite this incredible survival strategy, these shy, nocturnal animals are critically endangered due to illegal wildlife trade and habitat loss, making them one of the most protected creatures on the planet.</p>
